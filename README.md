This repository implements the equations to calculate:
- sparsity,
- orthogonality,and
- dynamics awareness

for analysing neural network representations based on the paper:
[Wang, Han, et al. "Investigating the properties of neural network representations in reinforcement learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.15955 (2022).](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15955)
